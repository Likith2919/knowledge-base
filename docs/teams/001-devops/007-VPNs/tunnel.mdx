This doc covers the why, where and how the ***`tunnels`*** are used in Ori.

## What is tunnel?

- A tunnel allows you to create a PORT forwarding connection from your machine to any remote server that you can connect to via ssh.
- It allows you to essentially assign a temporary domain to your local development environment which is useful while building app/services that required a callback URL to work.

- **For Example**
  - It is used in local whatsapp development
  - Any channel integration generally expects a working callback domain to send messages, notifications and other webhooks.

### We have two types of tunnels

- ***Local-Tunnel***: This is a generic tunnel mainly used for local WA development right now. In this, you're assigned an individual tunnel which is mapped to a personal ID of yours(*phone number in case of WA*). This allows you use the local WA number(*+9188514-26472*) to test your flows with your local OCS. Below is the *solution diagram* for the same.

- ***Dev Server Tunnel***: In this you stop the process(*ocs or any process for that matter*) on the development server and setup the tunnel such that all the traffic is now being routed from your local ocs process.

### Pre-requisites

- SSH access to the server you need to tunnel to.
- SSH access to the tunnel controller.
- Basic understanding on linux commands to start/stop and check logs .via pm2

#### Local-Tunnel

- If you don't have a local-tunnel assigned to you, ask the *DevOps* team to provision it for you.
  - You'll basically be assigned a port and url. For example:
  - for port `2001`, your backend url will be `https://local-tunnel1-2001.oriserve.com`. This means that after connecting to the tunnel, traffic to this domain will be routed through your local ocs(*running on port 8080*).
  - Similarly, we can have tunnels from range `2001-65536`
- This tunnel will be specific to a user and will be mapped to his/her personal ID, depending on the channel he/she is working on. For example:
  - wa_id(*phone number*) in case of WA
  - agentID in case of gbm, etc.
- Refer [this](./tunnel#we-have-two-types-of-tunnels) for a basic solution diagram.
- Make sure OCS is running on local on port 8080.
- Once your tunnel is provisioned and details have been shared with you by the *DevOps* team. You can run a tunnel command in a separate terminal tab. *Be sure to save this command as this will be bound to you*.
  - For example, if port `2001` was assigned your tunnel command will be `ssh -N -R 127.0.0.1:2001:127.0.0.1:8080 ori-dev@13.235.64.204` and the backend URL will be `https://local-tunnel1-2001.oriserve.com`
  - Similarly, if port `2009` was assigned your tunnel command will be `ssh -N -R 127.0.0.1:2009:127.0.0.1:8080 ori-dev@13.235.64.204` and the backend URL will be `https://local-tunnel1-2009.oriserve.com` and so on.
- Once tunnel is created successfully, you can visit your assigned URL and should get the signature `Chatbot` page of ori. If you don't then there likely was an issue with the tunnel creation. You'll also notice access logs in you local OCS logs.
- You can disconnect a tunnel by doing `ctrl+c` on the terminal tab where tunnel is running.

----

#### Dev Server Tunnel

- ssh into the dev server
- Get the ocs process id
  - `pm2 ps`
- Stop ocs process on server
  - `pm2 stop id`
- Run ocs on local on port 8080
- In a separate terminal tab, start tunnel from local
  - `ssh -N -R 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 ori-dev@ip`
  - You can verify that tunnel is successfully working by hitting the backend URL of the dev server in the browser. If the tunnel is connected as expected, you should see the signature `Chatbot` page in the browser and you'll notice a hit in your local OCS logs.
- Once testing is done, make sure to close tunnel. This can be done by doing `ctrl+c` on the terminal tab where tunnel is running.
- Make sure to start the process on server again
  - `pm2 start id`

***Note***: It is very important that you **`stop`** the ocs process on dev server before you create the tunnel and **`start`** the process back after you're done.

#### Local-Tunnel

- Refer [this](./tunnel#we-have-two-types-of-tunnels) for a basic solution diagram.
- ***Pre-Requisites***
  - Go to the accessmanagement repo.
  - First verify whether user key is present in `all_keys`.  If it is not, ask with the person and get the .pub key add it in `all_keys` as `firstName_lastName.key`
  - Add the `key` in the users file inside the project `tunnel_controller`.
    - File path: `projects/tunnel_controller/userKeys/users`
  - Push the code in your branch and raise PR to the main branch ***v2***.
  - After the request is merged, Run this job [Link](https://jenkins.oriserve.com/view/accessManagement/job/test-accessmanagement/)
- ***Lambda***
  - In the *awsLambda* repository go to [DO-547/genericTunnel_dev](https://bitbucket.org/ori-nipun/awslambda/src/ea08cfa0f47664d5c7570dceb7656c70d5c6257b/?at=DO-547%2FgenericTunnel_dev) branch and create a new branch from it.
  - Under the directory `code/constants/differentiatorMappings`
    - Add the respective differentiator mapping for the user's ID for the type of channel the user has requested the tunnel for. For example in case of WA
    - In the file, `code/constants/differentiatorMappings/nativeWhatsApp.js`
    - Make the following changes to the variable `differentiatorMapping` as shown below
    - Add a `wa_id`(*phone number*) and it's corresponding `user_name` and `env`

      - ```javascript
          const differentiatorMapping = {
              //wa_id or recipient_id: {userTunnel: 'name', env: 'local/dev/uat/prod'}
              "918588834999": { userTunnel: 'nipun_jain', env: 'local' },
              // "919205979839": { userTunnel: 'shivanshu_chaurasia', env: 'local' },
              "919599281176": { userTunnel: 'mayank_harbola', env: 'local' },
              "918085149997": { userTunnel: 'prasanna_bisen', env: 'local' },
              "919891239146": { userTunnel: 'ajay_saini', env: 'local' },
              "918076153618": { userTunnel: 'akash_dagar', env: 'local' },
              "917004516734": { userTunnel: 'mrityunjay_kumar', env: 'local' },
          }
        ```

  - In the file `code/constants/constants.js`
    - Make the following changes to the variable `envUserBrandWebhook` as shown below
    - Add the `user_name` and `URL` mapping in the respective `env` block.
    - If a new user is to be added, replace one of the `port_numbers` on the left with the `user_name`. Similarly, more can be added in the same format.
    - Note the `port_number` and the `URL` for the `user_name`.

    - ```javascript
        const envUserBrandWebhook = {
            local: {
                "nipun_jain":           "https://local-tunnel1-2000.oriserve.com",
                // "shivanshu_chaurasia":  "https://local-tunnel1-2001.oriserve.com",
                "mrityunjay_kumar":     "https://local-tunnel1-2001.oriserve.com",
                "prasanna_bisen":       "https://local-tunnel1-2002.oriserve.com",
                "mayank_harbola":       "https://local-tunnel1-2003.oriserve.com",
                "ajay_saini":           "https://local-tunnel1-2004.oriserve.com",
                "akash_dagar":          "https://local-tunnel1-2005.oriserve.com",
                "2006":                 "https://local-tunnel1-2006.oriserve.com",
                "2007":                 "https://local-tunnel1-2007.oriserve.com",
                "2008":                 "https://local-tunnel1-2008.oriserve.com",
                "2009":                 "https://local-tunnel1-2009.oriserve.com",
                "2010":                 "https://local-tunnel1-2010.oriserve.com",
            },
            dev: {
                "vi-neo": "https://vi-neo-dev.oriserve.com"
            },
            uat: {
                "vodafone": "https://webtest.vodafone-elb.oriserve.in/gbc",
            },
            prod: {
                //bajaj
                "bajaj": "https://bajaj.oriserve.com/gbc"
            }
        };
      ```

  - In this example
    - `nipun_jain` is mapped to `https://local-tunnel1-2000.oriserve.com` implying he's assigned port `2001`
    - `ajay_saini` is mapped to `https://local-tunnel1-2004.oriserve.com` implying he's assigned port `2004` and so on.
  - Once this is done, commit and push the changes and raise a PR for it.
- ***Route53***
  - Map the required `URL`, calculated in the previous step with the ***Tunnel Controller*** server IP. IP can be found from the EC2 console. Example:
- ***Tunnel Controller***
  - Create and add the required nginx conf and generate the SSL for the new tunnel domain which was mapped.
  - For naming convention take reference from previously added configurations.
  - Add the certificate renewal commands for the new `URL` in `/renewCerts/renew_certs.sh`

#### Dev Server Tunnel

- Read and understand the documentation mentioned in the developer section. No additional steps is required to set it up from *DevOps* point of view.
- Just make sure the pre-requisites are met
