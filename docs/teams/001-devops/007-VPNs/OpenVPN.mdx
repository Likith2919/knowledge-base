The docs cover the OpenVPN Clients installation.

## Introduction

- We are using various VPNs to connect to the private remote network and avoid using the public network.

- VPNs that we use here :
  - OpenVPN (supported by Windows, Mac, Linux)
  - sshuttle (supported by Mac, Linux)
  
## What is OpenVPN

- OpenVPN is an open source connection protocol used to facilitate a secure tunnel between two points in a network.
- When you connect to the internet, particularly on a public network, there is a risk involved in transmitting sensitive data across the network. This is why it’s considered a best practice to never log into your bank while on public WiFi.

- when you connect to a Virtual Private Network, or “VPN”, using the OpenVPN protocol, your data is secured behind a strong encryption.
