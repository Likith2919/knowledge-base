## Steps to enable MFA for your AWS account

- In the navigation bar on the upper right, choose your user name, and then choose ***[My Security Credentials](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials)***.
  - ![navbar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/security-credentials-user.shared.console.png)
- Now add an MFA device. In the Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) section, choose Assign MFA device. Meanwhile download the ***Google Authenticator*** app on your phone.
  - ![Assign MFA](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/oriserve.com/docusaurus/aws/mfa1.png)
- Choose ***Virtual MFA device***, and then click Continue.
  - ![Select MFA Device](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/oriserve.com/docusaurus/aws/mfa2.png)
- On the Google Authenticator app:
  - Click the (+) plus icon in the bottom left.
  - Select scan a QR code.
- From the wizard, choose Show QR code. Then use the app to scan the QR code.
- In the Manage MFA Device wizard, in the MFA Code 1 box, type the one-time password that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30 seconds for the device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second one-time password into the MFA Code 2 box.
- Choose Assign MFA.
- Sign out and Sign in once for the changes to take effect.

## Working with with AWS SDK/CLI with MFA enabled accounts

***AWS CLI*** or ***AWS SDK*** calls wit won't work as expected if an IAM users has ***MFA*** enabled.  

### Prerequisite

- [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- AWS access and an IAM user with the necessary permissions. If you don't have this raise a [request](/docs/teams/devops/policies/request_access) with the DevOps team.
  - You'll need AWS programmatic access that means your ***AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID*** and ***AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY***.
  - You'll also need AWS console access to setup [MFA](./mfa#steps-to-enable-mfa-for-your-aws-account) as explained in the linked document.
    - If AWS console access is not required for any other reason, please ask the DevOps team to disable the access once you've successfully linked a MFA device with your IAM user
  - You'll need your MFA device ID from the IAM console, if you're not sure how to get this, ask a DevOps team member to help you with the same.
- Finally, you'll need to configure [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) on your local machine.
  - You can either set this up by manually by running the command and then filling the interactive prompts as shown below
    ``` shell
    aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: your_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: your_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    Default region name [None]: ap-south-1
    Default output format [None]:
    ```
  - Or, you may use the credentials.csv file which must've been shared with you by the DevOps team as shown below
    ``` shell
    aws configure import --csv file://location_to_csv_on_local/your_credentials_file_name.csv
    ```
- Now you can use the below helper script to setup temporary credentials. These will be valid for 3 days, so you'll have to rerun the script once the credentials expire

  MFA_ID=$1

  ## Setup tmp folder for tmp files
  [[ -d ~/aws_tmp_files ]] && (echo "Old aws_tmp_files directory found in ${HOME} directory, deleting it." && rm -rf ~/aws_tmp_files)
  mkdir -p ~/aws_tmp_files && echo "Creating aws_tmp_files in ${HOME} directory for temporary files"

  ## Resetting previous env variables
  echo "\nPrevious environment variables"
  echo "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
  echo "\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
  echo "\nAWS_SESSION_TOKEN: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}\n"

  unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  unset AWS_SESSION_TOKEN

  echo "\nReceived MFA ID: ${MFA_ID}\nCURRENT MFA CODE: ${MFA_CODE}\n"
  ([[ -z ${MFA_ID} ]] || [[ -z ${MFA_CODE} ]]) && echo "Please provide both MFA ID and CURRENT MFA CODE" && return 1 || echo "Proceeding with token generation."

  ## Generating temporary credentials and token
  aws sts get-session-token --duration-seconds 129600 --serial-number ${MFA_ID} --token-code ${MFA_CODE} > ~/aws_tmp_files/aws_creds.tmp

  [[ $? -ne 0 ]] && echo "Token generation failed. Please try later." && return 1 || echo "Token generated successfully!"

  ## Setting new env variables
  echo "export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo $(cat ~/aws_tmp_files/aws_creds.tmp  | awk '/AccessKeyId/ {print $2}' | sed 's/,//g;s/"//g'))" > ~/aws_tmp_files/set_env
  echo "export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo $(cat ~/aws_tmp_files/aws_creds.tmp  | awk '/SecretAccessKey/ {print $2}' | sed 's/,//g;s/"//g'))" >> ~/aws_tmp_files/set_env
  echo "export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(echo $(cat ~/aws_tmp_files/aws_creds.tmp  | awk '/SessionToken/ {print $2}' | sed 's/,//g;s/"//g'))" >> ~/aws_tmp_files/set_env
  source ~/aws_tmp_files/set_env

  echo "\nNew environment variables"
  echo "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
  echo "\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
  echo "\nAWS_SESSION_TOKEN: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}\n"

  echo "\n\nNote: To utilise these credentials in any other terminal tab/window, you'll need to run the below command in that terminal tab/window"
  echo "      source ~/aws_tmp_files/set_env \n"

  return 0
  ```

- Place the script anywhere, save it as ***generate_aws_tmp_creds.sh***
  - Add execute permissions to the script
  - Run it in the terminal as below from the directory where the script is placed

    ```shell
    cd dir_to_put_the_script_in
    ## either copy/paste with GUI or use vim/nano
    vim generate_aws_tmp_creds.sh
      ## paste the above script
      ## :wq! to save and exit vim

    chmod +x generate_aws_tmp_creds.sh
    source ./generate_aws_tmp_creds.sh arn:aws:iam::921625340362:mfa/NipunJain_ORI 123456
    ```

- Once the helper script runs successfully it shall display the new AWS temporary credentials it exported, if you don't see those contact the DevOps team.
  - Here's a screenshot of how a successful script run will look like.
  - ![example](/img/aws/auto_mfa_helper_example_mac.png)
- These variables will be available only in the current terminal tab. If you want to use these in other open tabs, you'll need to do the following additional step

    ```shell
    source ~/aws_tmp_files/set_env
    ```

  - Here's screenshot showing initially the required variables were empty, but after the above command we can see variables were seeded.

- That should do it. You should now be able to perform action allowed as per your IAM user with ***AWS CLI*** and ***AWS SDK***.
- If you face any issues, please contact the DevOps team
