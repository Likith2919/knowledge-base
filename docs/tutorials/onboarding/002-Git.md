## How to create pull request 
Using a pull request, you're requesting that another developer or the project owner pull a branch from your repository and add it to the project. Here's how to create a pull request from the Bitbucket website.

To create a pull request, you'll have to make sure that your branch is updated with new code that you want to be reviewed. Before going any further, check and save your work on the local machine and update the branch.

Then, open the Bitbucket website on your browser and navigate to the repository.

Click on the menu button in the top-left, and select **Pull Requests**.

Here, click on the **Create pull** request button.

The pull request creation form will open.

There are a few things to do on this form:

* From the left dropdown menu, select the sub-branch (source repository) that you want to merge into the master branch.

* On the right, make sure that the project and the master branch (destination repository) are selected.

* You can create a separate title for the pull request and write a short description of the code that you've written or the task that you've completed.

* At the bottom, you'll indicate the Reviewers. This is the most important step: Type in the name of one or more developers who need to review your code.

* If you automatically want to close the branch once the pull request is merged, click the Close branch checkbox.

Before submitting the request, you can scroll below the form to take a look at the code differences between the test branch and the master branch and go over the recent commits.

Once you're confident about it, click Create pull request.

The process from your side is now complete. The reviewers will get an email notification about your pull request. They'll be able to view all the contents of your branch, compare it with the master branch, and leave comments.

Once they're satisfied with your work, they can click Merge to merge your branch's code with the master branch.
